This extension, **Porn Blocker**, is committed to protecting your privacy.  
We believe in transparency, and we want you to understand what data is (and is not) collected when you use this extension.

## Information We Collect
Porn Blocker **does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data**.  
All blocking and filtering is performed locally on your device using Chromeâ€™s built-in `declarativeNetRequest` API.

We do not:
- Collect personally identifiable information (name, email, etc.)
- Collect browsing history or user activity
- Track, log, or transmit search queries
- Store any information on external servers

## How the Extension Works
- The extension uses a **static blocklist** of known adult websites to block access.  
- It also monitors **search query parameters** locally to block harmful terms on search engines.  
- All filtering happens entirely inside your browser.

## Data Sharing
Porn Blocker does not share, sell, or transfer any data to third parties.
